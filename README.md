#pi-hub actuator hub (incomplete)

A fun hack on a long weekend.  I've attached:

1. Two RGB LEDs, embedded in a plasticine Nina
2. A lightsaber toy
3. A Wedding March circuit
4. A Homer Simpson Toy
5. A motor

to my Raspberry Pi, running a Ninja Blocks image.  My intention is to make these actuators devices on my Dashboard, and activate them on the basis of interesting things that happen on the web.
